# CS-250_SprintReviewRetrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  When engaging with users it is important to focus on what users want. Asking questions like what features need to be improved or what is missing. Understanding the needs of the users will ultimately improve the product overall. Having user stories for stakeholders is a necessary part. It is a way back up why certain changes are propsed when communicating with stake holders. User stories help developers create for users needs.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  When developing programs I try to have a user focused approach. Working directly with the end user is helpful because the product starts out focused on the user. This will most likeley lead to less changes later in the development process. Some benefits from Scrum that I will incorporate are rapid iteration, increased communication, and ability to better meet clients needs with focused teams. Being able to quickly iterate and make changes means that customers’ needs can be met quicker. Scrum meetings and Sprint planning help teams to communicate more effectively and purposefully. With the use of the “Two Pizza Rule” we can create teams in a size that will allow for use to prioritize our clients needs. Small, specialized teams mean that clients can have the full attention of the team.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  To be a good team member would mean communicating effectively and completing the tasks assigned on time. Also being able to help other team members if they need it. Being able to explain your work to your other team members in a way that they will understand and commenting your code. The best way to be a good team member is to be respectful of your other team members.
